# Phishinabarrel

This serves 2 purposes: automate the work described here: https://decentsecurity.com/#/malware-web-and-phishing-investigation/, and give me a reason to get better at python. Some of the pages don't include APIs, some have APIs you have to pay for, and I'm not all about that. Ideally, a responder will be able to put a URL into the script as an argument and both check and submit it as malicious if it fails checks. As of ~~10.8.17~~ 6/6/18 (wow), it's not ready yet, but here's what I got so far. 


I borrowed from https://github.com/doomedraven/VirusTotalApi/blob/master/vt/vt.py for the output in lines 61-70. That will probably change when I figure out how I want to do this.
